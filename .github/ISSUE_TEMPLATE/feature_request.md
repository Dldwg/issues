**What's your idea for a cool feature that would help you use OHM better.**
Please provide a clear and concise description of the problem you'd like to solve & how you'd like to solve it. Or, the other way around!

e.g. I'd like to have the inspector show time-related pictures of the object, so I can get a better idea of what the place was like at the time.

**Current workarounds**
Is there any way to meet this need using a workaround or "hack" right now?

**Additional info**
Please add any other context, comparables, screenshots, pictures of drawings on napkins about the feature request here.
